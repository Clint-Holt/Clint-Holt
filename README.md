### About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, having recently completed my Ph.D. in Chemical and Physical Biology at Vanderbilt University. My research is at the intersection of computational biology, immunology, and machine learning, with a focus on developing more effective vaccines and antibody therapeutics. I analyze large-scale immune receptor sequence and structural data to advance antibody discovery and characterize B cell receptor repertoires.

[cite_start]My work has led to the development of antibody large language models and computational methods for high-throughput antibody discovery [cite: 9][cite_start], the creation of experimentally validated, epitope-focused vaccine strategies for broad protection against influenza and coronaviruses [cite: 10][cite_start], and the engineering of biologics for autoimmune diseases[cite: 11]. [cite_start]My goal is to expand beyond infectious disease applications to develop sophisticated AI models that accelerate therapeutic discovery across various immunological disorders[cite: 11].

### Research Interests

My primary research interests include:
* [cite_start]Developing and applying machine learning models, particularly large language models, for antibody discovery and B cell receptor repertoire analysis[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]Creating epitope-focused vaccine designs that offer broad protection against viruses like influenza and coronaviruses[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]Engineering antibody therapeutics and other biologics to target autoimmune diseases[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]Integrating multi-modal structural and functional epitope data to guide the iterative design of vaccines and therapeutics[cite: 103, 107].
* [cite_start]Building and utilizing large-scale biological databases to support machine learning and protein engineering cycles[cite: 105].

### My Projects

Here are some of the key projects I have contributed to:

**1. [pan-betacov-S2-antibody](https://github.com/IGlab-VUMC/pan-betacov-S2-antibody)**
[cite_start]This repository contains the data and code for our 2024 *Structure* publication on the discovery and characterization of a pan-betacoronavirus S2-binding antibody[cite: 29]. [cite_start]As a co-first author on this 32-researcher study, my role involved significant data analysis and computational work that contributed to the characterization of this antibody[cite: 160].

**2. [AbLangRBD1](https://github.com/IGlab-VUMC/AbLangRBD1) and [AbLangPDB1](https://github.com/IGlab-VUMC/AbLangPDB1)**
[cite_start]These repositories are associated with my first-author paper, "Contrastive Learning Enables Epitope Overlap Predictions for Targeted Antibody Discovery" [cite: 27][cite_start], which is currently under review at *Patterns*[cite: 121, 155]. In this work, I developed a contrastive learning framework using PyTorch to fine-tune antibody large language models. [cite_start]This method improves epitope representation and has achieved 50-70% hit rates in identifying biotherapeutic candidates[cite: 101]. [cite_start]These repositories contain the code and data to reproduce the analysis, demonstrating my skills in machine learning, PyTorch, and large-scale data analysis[cite: 118].
